# readme-generator
<br>
Convert those boring plain text readmes to github markdown automagically
# Usage:
<code>python 3 converter.py</code>
<br>
The script will automagically find you README.md and place the completed file in OUTPUT.md.
<br>
Currently, it will also put the languages used at the bottom of the readme, along with how many bits were written in that language.
<br>
Markdown Linebreaks are inserted wherever a "\n" exists in the text file.
<br>
Lines that end with a colon and have a blank padding line below will become markdown headings.
<br>
This readme was generated with the script!
